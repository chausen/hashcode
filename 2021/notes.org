- If light is green, 1 car can cross intersection every second
    - If green light lasts Ti seconds, only first Ti cars will go thru

* Schedule
- determines order and duration of green light for incoming streets of intersection
- repeats itself for duration of simulation
- schedule is list of pairs: (incoming street, duration)
- each street appears at most once
- can ignore some incoming streets

* Cars
- described by path (sequence of streets)
- goes through single intersection at least once
- start at the end of the first street in their path
- if two cars start at end of same street, first one in input goes first
- first car at intersection crosses immediately
    - queued cars after it go one per second
- does not queue up at the end of the last street of its path; immediately removed
